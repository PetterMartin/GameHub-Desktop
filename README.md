First off I must say that the design I coded doesn’t look anything like my Figma design. This is partially because I wasn’t happy with my original design and also that I wanted to test myself and try to design something new. My new design uses a more black/green pallet rather than black/gray. I did this to try differentiate it from other competitors and also give it a more appealing look for the customers.
